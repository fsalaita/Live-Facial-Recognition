What it can do:
	1. Live face recognition using OpenCV and deep learning with Python in real-time through a camera feed.
 	1. Using the deep face library, it compares the real-time camera frames with a reference image to determine if there is a match.
  	1. Integrates OpenCV for camera interaction and visualization, displaying the camera feed in a window and providing real-time feedback on face recognition results.
   	1. Implementes threading to efficiently handle face recognition tasks separately from the main loop, optimizing performance.
    	1. Incorporates error handling mechanisms to address potential issues, such as handling value errors when the deep face library does not recognize a face in the image.
