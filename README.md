# What it can do:
---

- Live face recognition using OpenCV and deep learning with Python in real-time through a camera feed.
- Using the deep face library, it compares the real-time camera frames with a reference image to determine if there is a match.
- Integrates OpenCV for camera interaction and visualization, displaying the camera feed in a window and providing real-time feedback on face recognition results.
- Implements threading to efficiently handle face recognition tasks separately from the main loop, optimizing performance.
- Incorporates error handling mechanisms to address potential issues, such as handling value errors when the deep face library does not recognize a face in the image.
